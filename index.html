                <p> Junior Enterprise for Science and Technology — JEST — was born from the interest in learning while working and the will to do so.

                    A project rooted in the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University of Coimbra, featuring a multidisciplinary team with experts and enthusiasts in several different areas, ranging from programming to graphic design. We value the development of personal and professional skills by all our members, as well as the dynamic and productive interaction with the business, scientific and academic fields in the Coimbra area.

                    Furthermore, we have a constant commitment to evolve and understand the environment in which we, as a Junior Enterprise, are included, assessing where we can best apply our projects while reaching out to other businesses and entities.

                    Our main focus is on data science, offering services in experimental design, data analysis, and predictive and computational modelling, to name a few. By doing so, we hope to contribute positively to all involved in JEST - our partners, our members and, most importantly, those who choose to work with us.

                of
                data science, ranging from life sciences to all sorts of statistical treatment and data science in its
                core.
                JEST is offering you the unique opportunity to learn R from people doing research with it in two
                modules.
                The first, on the 28th and the 29th of November, grants you the opportunity to learn the first steps of
                R.
                It is a module designed for both the absolute beginner and the practitioner that needs to refresh basic
                concepts or relearn forgotten ones. Furthermore, basic programming skills and concepts will be
                addressed, in
                order to establish solid ground for future projects and work habits that scale up on the long run for
                the
                most efficient time expenditure. This will be a three hour module and the main topics below will be

                    that
